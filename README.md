#A Responsive Image Gallery with Flexbox CSS

The new Flexbox module can help in creating complex layouts in HTML. Flexbox can be considered as HTML tables on steroids, without the limitations of tables and the ability to use any semantic tag. Even the new big CSS Frameworks coming out soon, like Bootstrap 4.0, rely heavily on Flexbox to provide their layout features.

Flexbox is a CSS-based container layout module. The key to understanding Flexbox is that it is a container manipulation tool, defining the overall behavior on the container.
